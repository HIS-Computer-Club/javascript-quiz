Note: this is only for us to know the progresses of everyone, no body will got kick out or something.

Just send us the code with question numbers to each section.



##### Question structure

1. Question story

- Requirement
  - Example input(s)
    - Expected output(s)



##### Questions

1. There is a famous Fibonacci sequence, which is 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55 ……

- Write a function with input of number n, output the n’st Fibonacci number, For example:
  - f(1)
    - 1
  - f(4)
    - 3
  - f(10)
    - 55



2. There is a article, we need to count how much letter is in the article

* Write a function with input of String 'n', output length of string, include the spaces, For example:
  * f('Hello')
    * 5
  * f('Is there anyone?')
    * 16



3. There is a student called Simon, Simon always use "he" where should be "she", and "she" where should be "he"

* Write a function with input of String 'n', output the string with each "she" become "he", "he" become "she",
  * f('He is a very pretty')
    * 'She is very pretty'
  * f('When is the sunset?')
    * 'When is the sunset?'
  * f('She give a nice pot to her, and he have a gift for him also')
    * 'He give a nice pot to her, and she have a gift for him also'



4. Alex don't know domain and range, but he know it must be a number

* Write a function that will return true if the input is a number, otherwise randomly return 'Domain' or 'Range'
  * f(2)
    * true
  * f('wow')
    * 'Domain' or 'Range'
  * f('3')
    * 'Domain' or 'Range'



5. Dominick need to calculate factorial of some Number

* Write a function that will return another function, first function as for where to start, and second ask how much number to stop, return the numbers times together. if is 4 and 5, it return 4\*5\*6\*7\*8 which is 6720
  * f(0)(12)
    * 0
  * f(3)(2)
    * 12
  * f(10)(8)
    * 980179200
